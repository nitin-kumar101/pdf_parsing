The heart of studies in parsing is the template extraction from raw log data.\nFundamentally, this process consists of identifying the constant and variable parts of raw\nlog messages.\nSeveral approaches rely on the “textual similarity” between the log messages. Aharon\net al. (2009) create a dictionary of all words that appear in the log message and use the\nfrequency of each word to cluster log messages together. Somewhat similar, IPLOM\n(IterativePartitioningLogMining)leveragesthesimilaritiesbetweenlogmessagesrelated\nto the same event, e.g., number, position,",

Overall, it is possible that relevant\nstudies might be missing in our analysis.\nOne way to address this limitation is by analyzing the proceedings of conferences and\njournals on different years to identify missing entries. In our case, we have 46 after the\nselection process. Another approach is by applying backwards/forward snowballing after\nthe selection process. While Google Scholar provides a “cited by” functionality that is\nuseful for that purpose, the process still requires manual steps to query and analyze the\nresults.\nNevertheless,whiletheaforementionedapproachesareusefultoavoidmissingstudies,\nwearguethatthenumberofpapersandvenuesaddressedinourworkisarepresentative\nsample from the research field.

To\nreduce its impact, the first author performed the procedure twice.
